# summary

Pull changed source from the org to your project to keep them in sync.

# description

If the command detects a conflict, it displays the conflicts but does not complete the process. After reviewing the conflict, rerun the command with the --forceoverwrite parameter.

# examples

- Pull source from your default org:

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %>

- Pull source from the org with alias "myscratch"; ignore any conflicts and overwrite the local project files with org changes; wait for only 5 minutes:

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --target-org myscratch --wait 5 --forceoverwrite

# flags.verbose.summary

# flags.forceoverwrite.summary
