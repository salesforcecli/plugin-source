# description

create a project manifest that lists the metadata components you want to deploy or retrieve
Create a manifest from a list of metadata components (--metadata) or from one or more local directories that contain source files (--sourcepath). You can specify either of these parameters, not both.

Use --manifesttype to specify the type of manifest you want to create. The resulting manifest files have specific names, such as the standard package.xml or destructiveChanges.xml to delete metadata. Valid values for this parameter, and their respective file names, are:

package : package.xml (default)
pre : destructiveChangesPre.xml
post : destructiveChangesPost.xml
destroy : destructiveChanges.xml

See https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_deploy_deleting_files.htm for information about these destructive manifest files.

Use --manifestname to specify a custom name for the generated manifest if the pre-defined ones donâ€™t suit your needs. You can specify either --manifesttype or --manifestname, but not both.
