Commands for interacting with metadata in Salesforce orgs.

This plugin is bundled with the [Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli). For more information on the CLI, read the [getting started guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_intro.htm).

We always recommend using the latest version of these commands bundled with the CLI, however, you can install a specific plugin version or tag if needed.

## Install

```bash
sfdx plugins:install source@x.y.z
```

### Build

To build the plugin locally, make sure to have yarn installed and run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:salesforcecli/plugin-source

# Install the dependencies and compile
yarn install
yarn build
```

To use your plugin, run using the local `./bin/dev` or `./bin/dev.cmd` file.

```bash
# Run using local run file.
./bin/dev source:
```

There should be no differences when running via the Salesforce CLI or using the local run file. However, it can be useful to link the plugin to do some additional testing or run your commands from anywhere on your machine.

```bash
# Link your plugin to the sfdx cli
sfdx plugins:link .
# To verify
sfdx plugins
```
